SDL2 Meme Cascade Program

Overview:
The SDL2 Meme Cascade Program is a high-performance, real-time
application built with SDL2 for rendering cascading memes, audio
playback, and dynamic visual effects.

System requirements:
- Operating System: Linux, Windows, or macOS
- Graphics: SDL2-supported hardware acceleration or software rendering fallback
- Audio: SDL2-supported audio output
- Memory: 100MB RAM (minimum)
- Storage: 10MB for program and assets
- Dependencies:
  - SDL2
  - SDL2_ttf

Build & run:
  make
  ./bin/meme_cascade

Program Features:
- Cascading Memes

Safety & performance considerations:
- Memory Safety: All resources, including textures and audio buffers,
  are allocated dynamically and freed upon termination or when no
  longer required. No direct memory manipulation is employed without
  safe abstraction layers.
- Real-time Execution: All rendering operations are conducted in
  real-time with a frame rate target of 60 FPS. Audio playback is
  synchronized to rendering, and frames are rendered with minimal
  latency.
- Failure Modes: The program will exit gracefully in the event of a
  critical resource load failure (e.g., missing texture or audio
  file). Warnings are logged to the console, and resource cleanup is
  performed upon termination.
- Concurrency: The program operates in a single-threaded environment
  to ensure deterministic behavior and minimize the risk of race
  conditions.

Usage Instructions:
- Upon execution, the user will experience a cascade of meme images,
  wiggling center image, synchronized audio, and dynamic text effects.

Known Limitations:
- Limited to 10 meme images on-screen simultaneously.
- Image scaling and velocities are fixed within predefined ranges.
- No support for custom input during program execution.
